There's the lamentable 1962 remake of \"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari,\" for instance, which not only eliminated the central figure of Cesare the somnambulist but also featured a Caligari who instead of practicing diabolic hypnotism spent his time showing the heroine offensive pictures. Other filmmakers have chosen the even more baffling route of changing almost nothing, such as Gus Van Sant's nearly shot-for-shot 1998 remake of \"Psycho.\" The number of disappointed moviegoers you risk in remaking a masterpiece from 1922 is smaller, for obvious reasons, but even so, the director Robert Eggers has made clear in any number of interviews his understanding that his new \"Nosferatu\" is re-engaging one of the greatest of the silent movies.

Murnau's \"Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror\" is itself a remake - an unauthorized adaptation of \"Dracula,\" Bram Stoker's compulsively readable fever dream of a novel - and Murnau and the screenwriter Henrik Galeen retained much of what was arresting about the original while slipping in their own major changes: They're responsible, for example, for the now-set-in-stone tradition that sunlight can destroy the vampire, a notion nowhere in Stoker's book. I likely saw \"Nosferatu\" at too impressionable an age. I was 6, PBS was showing such things and my babysitter was simply glad I wasn't burning down the house. But I would have been flattened by it whenever I saw it. It was like having felt a draft from a grave. (Its effects were so long-lasting that 30-something years later I published a novel inspired by the film and its production.) The whole thing wasn't so much petrifying as insidiously unsettling, and all of that started with the figure of Nosferatu himself. Max Schreck's performance is, 102 years later, still the benchmark for sinister and dignified repulsiveness. Schreck's vampire has the stillness of a figure in a bad dream or a spider on its web, and the world he inhabits is at times equally disconcerting.

That last aspect alone would seem to land this story in Robert Eggers's wheelhouse. Part of the subversive energy of movies like \"The Witch,\" \"The Lighthouse\" and \"The Northman\" derives from what feels like modern takes on historical characters in thrall to dark passions so that the distantly historical is both granted its strangeness and animated by a scrutinizing modern sensibility. At its best, his version both evokes and reconceives Murnau's most brilliant visual ideas. Murnau's masterful use of the opacities of dark archways from which the vampire can emerge and into which he can dissolve is both echoed and made new. Murnau's famously arresting use of shadows to visualize the vampire's defiling reach is reimagined when those shadows in this new version extend themselves in a 360-degree pan that evokes their vertiginous inescapability. And the shadow of the vampire's hand now extends across the entire city, repurposing the most memorable image from Murnau's \"Faust.\"", "doc_id": "machine_translation_en-bho_IN_#_news_#_nytimes.153341_#_5", "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "bho_IN", "hypothesis": "लेकिन सबसे अस्थिर करे वाला चित्र होत हव हटर क मेहरारू एलेन, हमार नायिका, जे बार-बार देखावल जात हव की टेलिपाथिक रूप से राक्षस के लहर पर हव, तब तक कि ऊ हजारों मील दूर होखअ, ताकि अच्छा अउर बुरा या इच्छा अउर घृणा जइसन बिपरीत चीजन के साफ होखअ लगत हव। कि अंतिम पहलू खाली एगो रबर बरजगस के बीच में होत हव। एह कहानी के रबर बरजगस के बीच में होत हव। एह कहानी के रबर बरजगस के बीच में होत हव। एह कहानी के रबर बरजगस के बीच में होत हव। एह कहानी के रबर बरजगस के बीच में होत"}

Energy was the top-performing sector Monday, thanks to gains in oil and natural gas prices. Our lone oil and nat gas name, Coterra Energy, was jumping roughly 3.8%.

A population where everyone just conformed to the two standard cis gender roles would indeed be much easier to control, so to a “Labour” government obsessed with means testing, pathologizing and cutting benefits, it’s of course desirable to treat “normality” as a virtue and any difference as disease to eliminate.\nI could talk about so many things, the awful CBT and soft conversion therapy I’ve personally received in the UK, how state surveillance and punishment disproportionately targets autistic people, how even punitive and inadequate psychological care is too hard to access, how outcomes are measured in “productivity” rather than happiness. A tendency that is not technic in the big machines or internet enabled devices way, but has infested every aspect of life as much as people fear tiktok attention spans have; people I want to ally with constantly crowing “just be normal” or getting sucked down a health and fitness grifthole.\nAn exhausting and sad card.

A much more positive card than we've had so far!\nBut it's hard to feel positive about the massively exploitative and yet still totally underwhelming reality of artifical intelligence and quantum computing hype at the moment. The idea of an omnipotent computer, that could, indeed, simulate or work at an atomic or subatomic level, has kind of been the great dream of computing for a long time. It's almost a philosopher's stone type of thing.\nYesterday I reread this great essay on the current generative AI models by Hito Steyerl (https://newleftreview.org/issues/ii140/articles/hito-steyerl-mean-images). She does a great job of going into how reliant these systems still are on human-made images, cleaned data, and ongoing human moderation at every level, but she also makes the observation that while their outputs masquerade as bits of text or images, which people wrongly attribute intention or creativity to, they're really statistical representations, with all of the inherent ideology and limitations of statistics baked in.\nWhat would a truly intelligent computer capable of expanding our analytical powers and relieving the burden of tedious labor and the risks of incomplete information look like, and under what context would it be used to reinvent life towards more autonomy and joy rather than accelerating exploitation and control? Can we hope for such a thing with IBM and DARPA still in the picture...?", "doc_id": "machine_translation_en-bho_IN_#_social_#_114259278941004365_#_4", "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "bho_IN", "hypothesis": "3 मार्च - सितारा, आशा परकास, परेरणा, भविष्य के लक्ष्य। अबहिन ले हमन के लगे एतना सकारात्मक कार्ड रहल। लेकिन अभी के समय में कलपना के बेअर्थ और बेअर्थ के बारे में बात करे में मुश्किल होत हव। एक कंप्यूटर के बारे में जे परमाणिक या सूक्ष्म स्तर पर काम कर सकेला, ये बात के बहुत सपना रहल हव। ई लगभग एगो दार्शनिक के पत्थर जइसन बात हव। कल हम एगो बहुत बढ़िया निबन्ध पढ़लीं हितो स्टीयरल दुआरा लिखल गयल (https://newleftreview.org/issues/ii140/articles/hito-steyerl-mean-images)। ऊ एगो बढ़िया काम करत हवँ ये समे के जनरलाइज्ड ए"}

A go-for-it type of thing.\nTimothy Leary certainly was a sort of intellectually driven, though more of a “question authority” type. Likewise, looking it up, the Eight-circuit Model of Consciousness here is generally thought to have little actual scientific credibility. Still… what model of consciousness does? Despite being how all of our “information” comes to us, it’s kind of ambiguous what this thing actually is, much less if there’s any systemic patterns that determine how it works.\nI find it kind of inspiring to contemplate a multi-part model of consciousness that is both inward and outward looking. Leary was also of a period where there was optimism about space exploration, and the possibility of making contact with other species, from Earth or beyond. Now we seem to find this idea kind of embarrassing, because the idea of explaining ourselves feels embarrassing. Which in a way is it’s own kind of constantly-reinforcing self-centeredness.\nThere’s nothing more self-centered in the irritating way than how psychedelics as self-help, a “miracle” mental illness cure, the one weird trick to go 10x or come up with that sick disruptive business deal or chill out your bitch wife, have kind of become mainstream now.

It doesn't fit because sometimes taper holders are a bit larger, there's different sizes of taper candles, but there is an easy workaround if you have a taper candle in a holder that you really want to use. And that is simply to melt the bottom side of your taper candle with a lighter or a match and let the wax drip in to the taper candle holder. And as it's still hot, press it into the holder and it's actually going to melt into the holder and kind of stand in the exact position that you want it to.
