    "description": "This paper details Yolu's submission for the WMT'25 General Machine Translation Task. Our work, situated within the constrained track, investigates the efficacy of Reinforcement Learning (RL) in enhancing machine translation. Our system is built upon the open-source Qwen3 model. We introduce a robust methodology for continuous performance improvement, which combines meticulous data cleaning with advanced data distillation techniques. This is complemented by a multi-stage optimization strategy, sequentially employing Continued Pre-Training (CPT), Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Contrastive Preference Optimization (CPO), and a novel policy optimization algorithm, Decoupled Clip and Dynamic sAmpling Policy Optimization (DAPO). Furthermore, we integrate a Quality Estimation (QE) model to facilitate online QE distillation, thereby refining the model's output during the decoding phase.",

For both versions, we applied the same training recipe with a first step of continual pre-training on parallel data, and a second step of supervised fine-tuning on high-quality instructions.\r\n\r\nThe BSC submission to the WMT25 General Machine Translation shared task is based on the 7B variant of \\salamandraTA. We first extended the model vocabulary to support the seven additional non-European languages included in the task. This was followed by a second phase of continual pretraining and supervised fine-tuning, carefully designed to optimize performance across all translation directions for this year's shared task. For decoding, we employed two quality-aware strategies: Minimum Bayes Risk Decoding and Translation Reranking using \\comet\\ and \\cometkiwi.\r\n\r\nWe publicly release both the 2B and 7B versions of \\salamandraTA, along with the newer \\salamandraTAversiontwo\\ model, on Hugging Face.",

No training data and model adaptation was used, as the goal of the approach was to test the viability of using a capable smaller off-the-shelf LLM in combination with a simple agentic system.\r\n\r\nBoth the self-refine system and the simple translator (both using a single instance of Gemma3 with 12B parameters) were used to translate all the texts of the WMT25 dataset (both the \"general\" and the \"multilingual\" pairs), and the results were evaluated using MetricX-24-XL. All the translations were performed and evaluated on the paragraph level. The scores demonstrated that the self-refine system resulted in competitive or slightly improved scores for the majority of language pairs.

The system relies on a minimalist Test-Time-Scaling pipeline: Sampling - Scoring - Selection. 1. Sampling: We utilize zero-shot Qwen 2.5 models (72B and 14B) 512 times under a fixed temperature schedule to produce a diverse set of candidate translations; 2. Scoring: Quality Estimation models (COMETKiwi, MetricX, and ReMedy) are then used to score every candidate to get its quality scores; 3. Selection: Finally, we select the best candidates based on a majority voting strategy using their QE scores. Our submission requires no fine-tuning, in-context examples, or specialised decoding heuristics. We participate in both unconstrained and constrained tracks.",

    "description": "The Laniqo's submission for the WMT25 General Translation Task uses EuroLLM-9B-Instruct as the base translation model. The approach involved creating a high-quality preference dataset by employing Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding using a subset of NewsPALM document-level data across various translation directions. This dataset was then used to train a LoRA adapter via Contrastive Preference Optimization. All previous WMT test sets, along with WMT24++, FLORES-200 and NTREX-128 were indexed in a vector search database. This database was queried to select few-shot examples for each prompt.  For the final translation output, the system first performs QE reranking, which is then followed by MBR decoding. Finally, rule-based post-processing steps were applied to refine the translations.",

    "description": "\\textsc{solo}-MultiagentMT's submission comprises a multi-agent translation model founded on the GPT series \\citep{kim:25:ir-multiagent-mt}. Leveraging our recent MQM model, designated as Rubric-MQM, which mitigates the labeling bias inherent in Gemba-MQM while enhancing its precision in detection, we employ the Prompt Chaining workflow. Within this framework, we deploy three agents: the Translation Agent, the Post-edit Agent, and the Proofread Agent. The Translation Agent is responsible for generating the initial translation in accordance with the officially supplied prompt. The Post-edit Agent identifies errors in the translation and classifies them using the MQM framework with severities from 1 to 4. An important feature of our agent is that it effectively post-edits by proposing improved translations for each identified segment. The Proofread Agent, utilizing the post-edited translation, enhances the outcome by rephrasing it in five different versions while taking into account fluency and adequacy, ultimately selecting the optimal translation. We submit two versions for the unconstrained track: the first, derived from the Post-edit Agent, and the second, from the Proofread Agent. All results are obtained using the GPT-4o-mini (2024-07-18), which incurs lower costs compared to GPT-4o or o3, with a temperature setting of 1 and a maximum token limit of 1024. Our experimental findings indicate that the greatest improvement is observed when the Post-edit Agent is incorporated into the process, particularly when the initial translation quality is high. Additionally, by achieving comparable results with a more cost-effective model, we propose a methodology for a self-improving machine translation model.\r\n@inproceedings{kim:25:ir-multiagent-mt,\r\n    title=\"IR-MultiagentMT at WMT 25 Translation Task\",\r\n    year=\"2025\",\r\n    booktitle=\"Proceedings of the Ninth Conference on Machine Translation(WMT)\",\r\n    publisher=\"Association for Computational Linguistics\"\r\n}",

    "description": "We present an English-to-Japanese translation system built upon the EuroLLM-9B\\cite{martins2025eurollm9btechnicalreport} model. The training process involves two main stages: continue pretraining (CPT) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT). After both stages, we further tuned the model using a development set to optimize performance. For training data, we employed both basic filtering techniques and high-quality filtering strategies to ensure data cleanness. Additionally, we classify both the training data and development data into 4 different domains and we train and finetune with domain specific prompts during system training. Finally, we applied Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding and paragraph-level reranking for post-processing to enhance translation quality.\r\n\r\n@misc{martins2025eurollm9btechnicalreport,\r\n      title={EuroLLM-9B: Technical Report}, \r\n      author={Pedro Henrique Martins and João Alves and Patrick Fernandes and Nuno M.

We participate in English-to-Russian translation direction and propose a purely LLM-based translation model.\r\nOur training procedure comprises a training pipeline of several stages built upon YandexGPT, an in-house general-purpose LLM.\r\nIn particular, firstly, we employ continual pretraining (post-pretrain) for MT task similar to Alves et.al., 2023 for initial adaptation to multilinguality and translation. Subsequently, we use SFT on parallel document-level corpus in the form of P-Tuning v2 (Lui et.al., 2021).\r\nFollowing SFT, we propose a novel alignment scheme of two stages, the first one being a curriculum learning with difficulty schedule and a second one - training the model for tag preservation and error correction with human post-edits as training samples.\r\nOur model achieves results comparable to human reference translations on multiple domains.",
