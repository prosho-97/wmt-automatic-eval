Chapter 2: First Impressions
The bus hissed as it came to a stop in front of St. Cassian’s entrance, its doors folding open with a mechanical sigh. 
Declan Hull sat in the second-to-last row, elbows propped on his knees, thumbs drumming anxiously against each other. His headphones rested around his neck, the music paused a while ago, but he hadn’t noticed. He’d spent the last hour watching pine trees blur past the window, wondering if this place would be like the others.

Temporary.
With a slow exhale, Declan rose to his feet, slinging the duffel bag over his shoulder. The blue canvas was stiff and new, the St. Cassian’s crest embroidered in gold on the side. It had been overnighted to him in anticipation for his arrival, along with his class uniform and team-issued hockey sweats. He’d conveniently ignored the uniform, pulling on the sweats instead. After seven hours crammed on a bus from Syracuse, he dared someone to say a word about him showing up late and out of dress code. 
The driver gave him a brief nod as he stepped off the bus.

The fall air was colder than he expected, brisk and sharp as it hit his lungs. He zipped his windbreaker up higher and adjusted his grip on the bag. His eyes scanned the wide campus, tracing the stone buildings and manicured lawns with casual disinterest until they landed on the rink in the distance.
There it was. The reason he was here.
Hockey was the one thing that always made sense, even when everything else didn’t.
On the ice, he was free. He could move how he wanted, think how he wanted, and he was good . Nothing else in his life had ever been that simple.

He shifted his bag higher on his shoulder, drawn toward the rink like muscle memory. His feet started moving without him even really deciding to. Then a voice snapped him out of it.
“Excuse me, sweetheart! New arrival?”
An older woman in a St. Cassian’s blazer was waving him down from the main entrance, clipboard in hand and a no-nonsense energy that made him stop in his tracks.
“Uh, yeah,” he said, squinting against the sun. “I’m Declan. Declan Hull.”
“Oh, hi, Declan.” She smiled as she caught up to him, a little out of breath but friendly. “I’m Heather Burke, Director of Admissions.” She extended her hand with practiced warmth, like she’d done this a hundred times before.

“Hi,” Declan said, reaching out to shake her hand. His grip was firm, but quick; polite enough, though his eyes kept drifting back toward the rink.
She noticed the way his gaze kept pulling back to the rink and smiled knowingly.
“You’re ready to get after it, aren’t you?” she said with a spark of encouragement. “Well, no point in delaying. I know your coaches are looking forward to meeting you. Shall we?”
She turned, already walking toward the rink, trusting he’d follow.
Declan didn’t say a word, just adjusted his grip on the duffel and fell in step, eyes fixed straight ahead.

”So,” she hummed, breaking the silence, “you missed the first two days of classes. I’ve got all your classwork and homework here.” 
She handed him a folder as they walked; blue and gold, stamped with the school crest in shiny foil. Declan almost rolled his eyes. Even the homework was branded.
“Normally, we have a zero-tolerance policy for late work,” she continued. “But given the circumstances, you’ll have until the end of the week to get it turned in. If you need a tutor to help you catch up, that can be arranged.”
Declan’s brain buzzed, already overloaded by the flood of expectations and deadlines. Heather must’ve picked up on it. She gave him a brief pat on the back, like that would somehow make it better.

"Don’t worry, everything you need to know is in the school handbook," she said, her tone casual, as though she was well-accustomed to the overwhelmed look on new students’ faces.
Right . The endless handbook they emailed over. As if he’d actually sit down and read all that.
Before Declan’s brain could short-circuit from the overload, Heather pushed open the doors to the rink. The blast of cold air hit him like a welcome shock, instantly calming the chaos in his head.
Finally. 
“Coach Benoit’s office is just through here,” Heather said, leading him down the hallway. 
She knocked on the door, and it swung open immediately. The man who stepped into view was the same one from the school website photo, his broad smile instantly recognizable. He beamed at Declan like an old friend.

“Declan!” he exclaimed with enthusiasm, his smile widening. “Welcome to St. Cassian’s. How was the ride in?”
“Long,” Declan said with a shrug, the weight of the journey still lingering in his voice. “But I’m just glad to finally be here.”
Luc stepped forward with a confident handshake, his grip firm but welcoming. “We’re thrilled to have you on board.” He turned to Heather with a smile. “Mrs. Burke, thank you for making the trek out to The Den.”
She waved him off with an easy smile. “Anytime. If you need me, you know where to find me.” With a final nod, she turned and swept out, her heels clicking in steady rhythm across the rink floor.

“Come on in, Declan,” Luc said as he opened the door and stepped aside to let him through.
Declan walked in but hesitated a few steps past the threshold. His gaze landed on a man already in the room, someone he recognized. His posture stiffened.
”Whoa, wait. You’re Kyle Barnes,” Declan said, the corners of his mouth lifting for the first time all day. The weight of the bus ride, the nerves, the folder full of homework gone for a moment.
Kyle’s smile was easy, confident. He stepped forward and extended a hand.
“Nice to meet you, Declan. I’ve heard a lot about you.”

Declan shook his hand, barely keeping the awe off his face. A breath slipped out, half disbelief, half nerves, and before he could stop himself, his mouth got ahead of his brain.
“I had you on my fantasy team last year. Not gonna lie, you lost me the championship.”
Declan pressed his lips together the second the words left his mouth, the grin fading as panic crept in. Nice one, he thought. Way to chirp an NHL vet five minutes into meeting him. He resisted the urge to bury his face in his hands.
A snicker sounded behind him. Declan glanced over his shoulder to see Coach Luc with a hand half-covering his mouth, doing a poor job of hiding his amusement. 

Kyle nodded, the corners of his mouth twitching as he fought back a smile. “Is that right? Sorry to let you down. Guess it’s a good thing I hung up the skates when I did, spare a few more fantasy teams the heartbreak.”
Declan opened his mouth, then quickly shut it again, heat creeping up the back of his neck. “I mean…your Cup run with the Kings was insane, though. That game seven OT goal? Unreal.” He scratched the back of his neck. “So… uh, what are you doing at St. Cassian’s? Are you coaching here now? I didn’t see you on the website.”

Luc settled into his chair, the leather creaking softly as he leaned back, then gestured to the seat across from him. “That’s actually what we wanted to talk to you about.”
Declan dropped into the chair, his duffel still slung across one shoulder, curiosity flickering behind his eyes. He wasn’t sure what he expected, but something about Luc’s tone made him sit a little straighter.
Luc leaned forward, resting his forearms on the desk, his tone shifting; slower now, more deliberate. He glanced over at Kyle, then back to Declan.
“Coming to a new school like St. Cassian’s is no small thing. You’re stepping into a new environment, away from home, with big expectations; on the ice, in the classroom, socially. That’s a lot for anyone, even a kid with your talent.”

He let the words breathe for a moment, letting them land before continuing.
“When we found out you’d be joining us, one of the first conversations we had was about how to make that transition easier for you. Where you’d land. Who you’d be around. Not just where you sleep at night, but where you’d feel like you had solid ground beneath you.”
Luc nodded toward Kyle. “Kyle and his family moved here this summer. His son, Ryan, is one of your new teammates. His wife, Nicole, she’s the kind of person who makes a place feel like home the second you walk in. And Kyle? Well, you know who he is.”

He paused again, not for dramatic effect, but because it mattered.
“He’s not on the coaching staff, at least not officially. But he’s part of something new we’re building here. A different kind of support system; player development, mentorship, leadership off the ice as much as on. And we want you to be part of that.”
Luc’s smile came easy, a little crooked. “So, here’s the offer: Kyle and his family have opened their home to you. If you’re open to it, we think it’s a great fit. But no pressure. We wanted to bring it to you first.”
Declan blinked, caught off guard. He hadn’t expected this. At all.

Every boarding school he’d been to had followed the same formula; dorms, roommates, shared bathrooms, and noise. This? Living off-campus? With a former NHL player and his family? That was…new. 
He glanced between Luc and Kyle, trying to read between the lines, to figure out if this was really optional or just dressed up to feel that way.
“I thought I’d be living on campus,” he said finally, his voice quieter, not confrontational, just honest.
Luc nodded, like he’d anticipated that reaction. “Totally fair. And yeah, most students do. But with your background, and the level we expect you to compete at, we wanted to try something a little different. Give you a foundation.”

Declan shifted in his seat, still trying to wrap his head around it. Living with Kyle Barnes. Having breakfast across the table from the guy who used to light it up in the league. It was a lot to take in.
Kyle let out a soft chuckle, picking up on the hesitation in Declan’s eyes. “It’s a lot to process, huh?”
Declan didn’t answer, but the look on his face said enough. He watched Kyle carefully, the weight of it all pressing in.
Kyle leaned back in his chair, settling into a more relaxed posture, but his eyes stayed sharp and knowing. “I’ve been where you’re sitting. New town. New team. Big pressure. It can mess with your head if you let it.”

Declan’s mind flickered through every worry he’d been carrying since stepping off that bus. Was Kyle reading him that easily? It felt like he was peeling back layers without even trying. That low, familiar buzz of uncertainty crept up again, and somehow, Kyle seemed to catch it without a word.
“I know it’s not easy, kid.” Kyle gave a small, almost fatherly sigh. His voice was lower now; gentle, but steady. “But here’s the thing. If you stay with us, you’re not just crashing at a billet house. I’m offering you space to breathe. A place to land when everything else feels like it’s spinning.”

Declan felt his throat tighten. Like the room had gone still for a second.
“Hockey’s a hell of a ride,” Kyle went on, “and yeah, I’ll push you. But I’ll have your back every step of the way. This isn’t just about stats or ice time, it’s about becoming the kind of player, the kind of person, who can handle the long haul. And I’ve been through the trenches. I know what that takes.”
He folded his arms casually, the edge in his voice softening into something more inviting. “It’s a big decision, I get that. So here’s what I’m thinking, you crash with us tonight. No pressure. See the house, meet Nicole and Ryan. Feel it out. Then tomorrow, if it feels right, we’ll talk.”

Declan didn’t even realize he was nodding until the motion was halfway done.
Something about the way Kyle spoke; calm, direct, like he actually got it. It cut through the usual static in Declan’s brain. He didn’t know what was happening, not really. Just that, for some reason, this guy already had a kind of hold on him. Not in a forced way. Just…steady. Solid. Like someone who meant what he said and wouldn’t flake the second things got hard.
No adult had ever made him feel that before. Not a teacher. Not a coach. Not even his own dad. 

So yeah, maybe he wasn’t sure about any of this, but his head kept nodding anyway.
“Okay,” he said finally. “I’ll give it a shot.”
Luc and Kyle exchanged a quick smile, something quiet and satisfied passing between them.
"Great!" Luc said, his enthusiasm palpable. He leaned forward, a spark in his eyes. "Any questions or anything on your mind before you head out to practice?"
Declan paused, the question hanging in the air for a moment. He glanced between Luc and Kyle, then shook his head. "I think I’m good for now."
"Alright, go ahead and get settled in," Luc said, standing up and motioning toward the hallway. "Locker room's down the hall to the right. Your name’s on one of the stalls, and your gear's already waiting for you."

Declan rose to his feet, clutching the duffel a little tighter.
Luc gave him a nod. “Practice starts in twenty. Coach Reynolds will meet you on the ice.”
Kyle stood too, that same calm energy still radiating off him. “I’ll see you after. Nicole’s making chicken parm tonight. Hope you’re hungry.”
Declan gave a half-smile without meaning to. “Yeah. Sounds good.”
And with that, he turned and headed for the hallway, trying not to overthink the million things racing through his head.
Practice flew by in a blur of crisp passes, sharp turns, and the unmistakable rush that only came when his skates hit fresh ice. Declan didn’t need time to adjust to that, his instincts kicked in from the first drill. It wasn’t long before heads were turning and quiet nods of approval passed between coaches.

It felt good. Easy. Like slipping into something that had always fit.
The locker room buzzed with post-practice energy; snapping tape, the thud of gear hitting benches, and a steady stream of chirps flying from stall to stall.
“Not bad for the new guy,” one of the defensemen called, grinning as he peeled off his jersey. 
Declan smirked as he unstrapped his pads. “Figured I’d show up, impress a little, then humble you tomorrow.”
A few guys let out loud “Oooohs,” one of them chucking a rolled-up sock at him.
As he dodged the sock, Declan caught Ryan watching him from across the room. Not in a hostile way, just…quietly. Studying. Like he was still deciding what to make of him.

Before Declan could read into it, Ryan stood, tugged his hoodie over damp hair, and headed out without a word.
The rest of the guys were still laughing and joking around, but that moment stuck.
Declan finished peeling off his gear and slung the duffel over his shoulder. When he stepped out into the hallway, he spotted them; Kyle and Ryan, standing just outside the rink doors. Kyle’s hand rested on his son’s shoulder, his voice low and calm, the kind of tone only a dad could pull off.
Ryan nodded at something, eyes on the ground. Declan didn’t catch what was said, but he could tell instantly that they were close. Really close.

It hit him in a way he didn’t expect.
Kyle glanced up and spotted Declan, a smile already forming as he lifted a hand in an easy wave. “There he is. You survive your first Coach Luc practice?”
Declan nodded, catching up to them. “Barely,” he said, though the grin tugging at the corner of his mouth gave him away.
Ryan gave him a short glance, but didn’t say much. Just gave a subtle nod, then walked ahead toward the parking lot.
“Come on,” Kyle said, clapping a hand gently on Declan’s back. “Let’s get you home.”
Home. The word sounded weird in his head. But as he followed them to the car, something in his chest loosened, just a little.

The car ride was quiet in a way Declan hadn’t realized he’d been craving. No one asked him questions or tried to fill the silence with small talk. Ryan had earbuds in, staring out his window. Kyle kept one hand on the wheel, the other resting casually on the console, humming now and then to the classic rock playing softly through the speakers.
Declan leaned his head against the window and watched the world roll by. The narrow roads wound through thick trees brushed with the first touches of fall; burnt oranges, deep reds, and gold. It was nothing like the city. The quiet felt intentional here. Peaceful.

He hadn’t noticed any of this from the bus, just the ache in his back and the buzz of nerves. But now…now it didn’t seem so bad.
The car turned off the main road and onto a quiet, tree-lined street, the tires humming softly against the worn asphalt. Declan glanced out the window, taking in the quaint homes tucked into the hillsides, most with wide porches and tidy yards. Everything felt still out here, like the whole world had taken a breath and held it.
They pulled into a modest driveway in front of a two-story house with deep blue siding and white trim. Warm yellow light glowed from the windows, casting a soft welcome as twilight settled over the neighborhood.

Kyle eased the car into park, the soft hum of the engine cutting through the quiet of the evening. He turned to look at Declan with a small smile. “This is us. Home sweet home,” he said, his tone light but with a quiet certainty, as if he were laying down an unspoken promise.
Declan didn’t answer, but he opened the door and stepped out. The air smelled faintly of pine and chimney smoke. Calmer than anything he’d felt in weeks.
Ryan was already unlocking the front door, his silhouette framed by the porch light.
Kyle gave Declan’s shoulder a gentle tap before heading up the steps. “Come on. Nicole’s got dinner waiting, and she’s been asking about you all day.”

The door swung open with a quiet creak, and warm air spilled out into the cool evening, carrying the unmistakable smell of garlic and tomato sauce. Declan stepped inside behind Kyle, the hardwood floors smooth under his sneakers and the house glowing with soft, ambient light that gave it a lived-in, welcoming feel.
“Hi!” a voice called from the kitchen. A moment later, a woman stepped out, wiping her hands on a dish towel. She was tall, athletic, with a sharp but warm energy that instantly filled the space. “You must be Declan.”
Declan hesitated for a moment, caught in the awkwardness of the moment. He nodded, unsure whether to wave or offer a handshake, his mind scrambling for a response. “Uh, yeah. Hi.”

Before he could say anything else, Nicole stepped forward, her arms open in a welcoming embrace. She pulled him into a hug without missing a beat.
“It’s so nice to meet you!” she said, rubbing his back gently in a motherly way before pulling back from the hug. “I’m Nicole. Hope you’re hungry, I made chicken parm. It’s a family favorite.”
“Yeah…starving, actually.”
Ryan had already disappeared upstairs, his footsteps fading above them, leaving the three of them in the open kitchen and living room. Declan took in the house. Family photos lined the walls, the dining table was half-set, and the smell from the kitchen was enough to make his stomach growl. Everything felt grounded, like people lived here and liked living here.

Nicole gestured toward a stool at the island. “Sit, relax. Dinner’ll be ready in a few. Any food allergies I should know about?”
“Nope.”
Kyle was already pulling plates from the cabinet. “He held his own at practice,” he said casually over his shoulder, like it was no big deal.
Nicole raised a brow at Declan. “Impressive. First day and already showing off?”
He shrugged, a flicker of pride sneaking into his chest. “Just trying to keep up.”
It felt…comfortable in a way he hadn’t expected. Like maybe, for once, he wouldn’t have to brace himself all the time.
By the time they sat down for dinner, that feeling hadn't gone away.

Declan hesitated only for a second before sliding into his seat next to Ryan, who was already digging in like it was a competitive sport. He glanced at his own portion and, after a quick taste, instantly understood why. The chicken parm was insanely good.
Declan took another bite, savoring the perfect balance of crispy breading and rich marinara. The flavors were way better than he expected, so much so that he couldn't help but mutter, “This is fucking good.”
The second the words left his mouth, the room fell dead silent. Ryan’s fork froze halfway to his mouth, his eyes snapping up to Declan with a mixture of shock and disbelief, like Declan had just unleashed a bomb at the dinner table. 

Declan, unaware of the shift, continued chewing, casually glancing around the table, still absorbed in the taste of his food.
Then he noticed it. The tension. The quiet.
Kyle’s voice broke the silence, calm but carrying an unmistakable authority. “Declan,” he said, his tone measured. “We don’t use that kind of language, especially not at the dinner table.”
Declan blinked, caught off guard. “Oh. Um, we...we’re hockey players though,” he shrugged, trying to brush it off. “It's kind of part of the deal.”
Kyle didn’t smile. His face remained impassive, though there was a flicker of something in his eyes, a reminder that this wasn’t some casual request. “Maybe on the ice, yeah, but even then, you’re too young for that kind of talk.”

Declan’s brow furrowed, his words tripping over themselves. “You- what?”
Kyle’s gaze was steady, never wavering. “In this house, we keep it clean. We respect the people we’re around.”
Declan's confusion was evident as he leaned over to Ryan, lowering his voice. “You don’t talk like that?” he asked, genuinely curious, not sure what to make of it all.
Before Ryan could answer, Nicole's voice rang out, light but firm. “Not if he doesn’t want soap in his mouth.”
Ryan’s eyes widened comically, panic creeping into his voice. “Mom!”
Nicole didn’t bat an eye. “Just saying,” she added with a knowing smirk.

Declan’s chest tightened. Soap in his mouth? Was she serious? He shot a look toward Kyle, but there was no humor in his eyes, just a quiet, resolute discipline.
Kyle cleared his throat and leaned back, his expression softening just enough to show he wasn’t angry, but he wasn’t backing down either. 
“Look, we get it. Hockey culture, the locker room, it’s different. We don’t mind a little edge when it's warranted, but when you're in my house, there are lines we don’t cross.” He gave Declan a pointed look, making sure the weight of the words settled. “You’re not just here to play hockey, you’re here to grow. And that means learning discipline, both on and off the ice.”

Declan couldn’t deny the way those words landed on him. His gut twisted a little, not from anger, but from something else. It wasn’t exactly comfort , but maybe that’s what he needed: boundaries. 
Ryan eyed him again, his face unreadable now, like he was sizing Declan up all over again. Nicole, on the other hand, was already back to plating up another round of food, acting like nothing had happened. But Declan could tell, this family didn’t mess around.
Declan let out a small exhale, unsure what to say. “Yeah, sure. Sorry about that.” 
He leaned back in his chair and stared at his plate, trying to collect his thoughts. The sudden shift in atmosphere threw him off. 

Kyle nodded, his voice softening again, but still carrying that same steady cadence. “It’s okay.” His mouth quirked in reassurance. “Alright. Now, eat up.”
Declan met Kyle’s gaze. He nodded, offering a sheepish grin. 
Ryan, still eyeing him like he’d just seen a rare species, let out a quiet sigh and turned his attention back to his food. Kyle gave Ryan a look that was all too familiar, a mix of casual suggestion and quiet command. 
“Hey, after dinner why don’t you help Declan get started on his homework?”
Ryan immediately groaned, his fork clattering against his plate. “I’m not a tutor.”

Kyle didn’t flinch. He just raised his eyebrows, the eyebrows, stern but patient. The kind that said: You sure about that answer, kid?
Ryan deflated with a dramatic sigh, like he’d just been asked to scrub the entire rink with a toothbrush. “Dad, come on, I’ve got my own homework to finish. And I’m seriously wiped out.” He slouched even further, practically melting into his seat.
Before the tension could stretch any further, Declan spoke up, casually throwing Ryan a lifeline. “It’s fine. Mrs. Burke said I could get a tutor or something to catch up. No big deal.”
Kyle kept an eyebrow raised at Ryan, then looked back at Declan with a nod. “That works. We’ll talk to the school tomorrow, get someone lined up for you.”

Ryan shot Declan a look, something between surprised and quietly grateful. He didn’t say thank you, but his shoulders dropped a little, the way they do when someone realizes they’ve just been spared.
Declan just shrugged, like it wasn’t a big deal. 
Nicole bit back a smile. “Don’t worry about Ryan. He’s a lot more agreeable when there’s dessert on the line.”
Ryan groaned once again from his seat. “You act like I’m some kind of dessert-driven gremlin.”
Kyle laughed and stood, stretching. “Aren’t you?”
Nicole gave Declan a conspiratorial wink. “He once folded all the laundry in the house for a slice of triple chocolate cake. Don’t let the brooding fool you.”

“I was ten.”
Declan smirked. “Good to know. I’ll keep chocolate cake in mind if I ever need a favor.”
The tight coil of nerves in his chest loosened just a little. The way they all moved around each other felt…safe.
He hadn’t realized how much he’d missed that kind of energy. Or maybe how little he’d ever had it in the first place.
After the last dish was rinsed and stacked, the clatter of plates gave way to the softer sounds of evening settling in. Kyle dried his hands on a kitchen towel and nodded toward the hallway. “C’mon, kid. Let’s get you set up.”

Nicole offered a gentle smile, already halfway up the stairs with a fresh set of linens tucked under her arm. Declan followed, duffel slung over one shoulder, the adrenaline of the day slowly giving way to exhaustion. 
The guest room was just off the staircase, second door on the left. When Nicole pushed it open, Declan blinked, surprised.
The room was a lot bigger than he expected.
Not massive, but comfortably spacious. Soft gray walls, a queen bed with a green comforter and a real headboard, not the cinderblock-and-mattress setup he was used to. A big window overlooked the backyard, and a framed print of TD Garden hung over the dresser. A small desk sat under a shelf lined with books and picture frames. It didn’t feel like a guest room. 

“Wow,” he muttered. “This is… seriously nice.”
Behind him, Kyle chuckled. “Look at that. You didn’t even drop an F-bomb this time.”
Declan shot him a smirk over his shoulder. “I’m learning.”
Nicole grinned as she set a folded blanket at the foot of the bed. “Fast learner, too. That’s good news.”
Kyle knocked gently on the door connecting to the bathroom. “You and Ryan share this. Jack and Jill setup. Two sinks, one shower. Just don’t spend an hour in there or he’ll lose it.”
“Noted,” Declan said, still eyeing the space like it might vanish if he blinked.

Nicole gave the comforter one last fluff. “Let us know if you need anything. Seriously. Make yourself at home.”
Kyle nodded once, giving him a brief clap on the shoulder. “Big day tomorrow, so get some rest.”
Nicole lingered for a second longer, then stepped forward and wrapped Declan in a quick, warm hug. He froze for half a beat, caught off guard, before awkwardly returning it.
“Good night, love,” she said softly, giving his arm a gentle squeeze before stepping back.
Declan blinked, unsure what to do with the sudden warmth in his chest. No one had called him that in…well, maybe ever.

“Night,” Declan mumbled, voice low.
Kyle paused at the door, gave him a look that was genuine. “We’re glad you’re here, Declan. Really.”
And just like that, they left him to it. The door left slightly ajar, like a quiet sign he wasn’t on his own here.
Declan stood for a moment, duffel still in hand, just taking it in. The house was quiet now, except for the faint sound of a TV down the hall and the occasional creak of floorboards.
He let out a long breath, dropped his bag by the desk, and sat on the edge of the bed. 
He kicked off his shoes and lay back, hands behind his head, eyes tracing the ceiling. Through the door of the Jack and Jill bathroom, he could hear faint movement; Ryan brushing his teeth maybe, or just walking around his own room. 
A shared wall, a shared life, starting now.
Maybe this year wouldn’t suck.
